# Comment-Aid
NOTE: This repo is copied from another private git repo. Code was actually developed by a team of developers, not only by arelsayed.


Comment-Aid is a chrome extension that can help users to respond to online hate/misinformation about Islam and Muslims.
Our vision is to make it help respond to hate and misinformation in general (not only Islam). 

Currently this is only a proof-of concept, not a fully functioning chrome extension. 

## Installation

1. Download this repo.
2. In your chrome browser, click on extensions (the puzzle icon) -> manage extensions
3. Click on Developer mode on the top right corner
4. Click on Load unpacked
5. Select the Comment-Aid folder that you downloaded.

## Usage

1. Select text you want to reply to.
2. Type "Ctrl+Shift+H" to launch the comment-aid extension (or click on the icon).
